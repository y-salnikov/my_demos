Overview

The AY-3-8910/8912 is a sound generator IC containing three tone generators and a white noise generator. In addition to its sound producing capabilities, the AY-3-8910 has two 8-bit I/O ports and the AY-3-8912 has one.
Pinouts


DA0-DA7 are multiplexed data and address lines, as used in the range of GI processors that this IC was originally part of. The BC1 and BDIR pins are used to control the IC as follows:
Function 	BDIR 	BC1
Inactive	0	0
Read		0	1
Write		1	0
Latch address	1	1

In addition to using BC1 and BDIR, A8 should be taken high to enable the chip. IOA0-IOA7 are the input/output pins (the AY-3-8910 has an additional set marked IOB0-IOB7). The IC does not contain an internal oscillator - the clock input to the CLK pin should fall between 1MHz-2MHz, so a typical Z80 system's clock would need to be divided.
Registers

The AY-3-8910/8912 contains 16 internal registers as follows:
Register 	Function 	Range
0	Channel A fine pitch	8-bit (0-255)
1	Channel A course pitch	4-bit (0-15)
2	Channel B fine pitch	8-bit (0-255)
3	Channel B course pitch	4-bit (0-15)
4	Channel C fine pitch	8-bit (0-255)
5	Channel C course pitch	4-bit (0-15)
6	Noise pitch	5-bit (0-31)
7	Mixer	8-bit (see below)
8	Channel A volume	4-bit (0-15, see below)
9	Channel B volume	4-bit (0-15, see below)
10	Channel C volume	4-bit (0-15, see below)
11	Envelope fine duration	8-bit (0-255)
12	Envelope course duration	8-bit (0-255)
13	Envelope shape	4-bit (0-15)
14	I/O port A	8-bit (0-255)
15	I/O port B	8-bit (0-255)
Notes

The AY-3-8912 does not contain register 15.
The volume registers (8, 9 and 10) contain a 4-bit setting but if bit 5 is set then that channel uses the envelope defined by register 13 and ignores its volume setting.
The mixer (register 7) is made up of the following bits (low=enabled):
Bit: 7 	6 	5 	4 	3 	2 	1 	0
I/O 	I/O 	Noise 	Noise 	Noise 	Tone 	Tone 	Tone
B 	A 	C 	B 	A 	C 	B 	A
The AY-3-8912 ignores bit 7 of this register. 

Envelopes

The AY-3-8910/8912 contains the following preset envelopes or waveforms (set using control register 13). Note that these affect volume only and not the pitch:
0	\_________	single decay then off
1	/	single attack then hold
4	/|_________	single attack then off
8	\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\	repeated decay
9	\_________	single decay then off
10	\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\	repeated decay-attack
11	\| 	single decay then hold
12	/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/|/	repeated attack
14	/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/	repeated attack-decay
15	/|_________	single attack then off
Pitch values

The course and fine pitch registers for each channel are used in the following fashion (assuming channel A):

Registers 0 and 1 operate together to form channel A's final pitch. The eight least significant bits are sent to register 0 and the four most significant bits are sent to register 1. The output frequency is equal to the IC's incoming clock frequency divided by 16 and then further divided by the number written to the course and fine pitch registers, so the higher the number written to these, the lower the pitch. For example, if a frequency of 1KHz was required and the IC's clock frequency was 1MHz, a total division rate of 1000 would be needed. The sound generator itself divides by 16 so the course and fine pitch registers must provide a further division by 62.5 (due to the fact that 1000/16 is 62.5). A division rate of 62 or 63 will be accurate enough, since the registers can only store whole numbers. Therefore, 62 or 63 would be written to register 0 and 0 would be written to register 1.

The following frequency table may be useful in musical applications:
Note 	Frequency (Hz) 	Note 	Frequency (Hz)
A 	220 	D# 	311.1
A# 	233.3 	E 	329.63
B 	246.94 	F 	349.23
middle C 	261.63 	F# 	370
C# 	277.2 	G 	392
D 	293.66 	G# 	415.3
Applications

The AY-3-8910/8912 (and derivatives) has found its way into a variety of home computers and games consoles including the following:

Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128/+2/+3
Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128
Mattel Intellivision
BBC Micro
Atari ST
Sega Master System 

Port Specifics

The control (register select) and data output ports are as follows (in decimal):
Machine Port Addresses
Machine Name 	Control 	Data
Spectrum 	65533 	49149
TS2068 	245 	246

So, to produce a simple sound from BASIC ...

10 LET ayctrl=65533
20 LET aydata = 49149
30 OUT ayctrl,7 : REM select the mixer register
40 OUT aydata,62 : REM enable channel A only
50 OUT ayctrl,1 : REM channel A course pitch
60 OUT aydata,50 : REM set it
70 OUT ayctrl,8 : REM channel A volume
80 OUT aydata,15 : REM set it to maximum

... or from assembler ...

ayctrl  EQU     65533
aydata  EQU     49149

start   ld      d,7             ; select the mixer register
ld      e,62            ; enable channel A only
call    outer           ; send it to PSG
ld      d,1             ; channel A course pitch
ld      e,50            ; pitch value
call    outer           ; send it to PSG
ld      d,8             ; channel A volume
ld      e,15            ; maximum
call    outer           ; send it to PSG
ret

outer   ld      bc,ayctrl       ; select control port
out     (c),d           ; send specified value
ld      bc,aydata       ; select data port
out     (c),e           ; send specified value
ret

For an easy way to generate the required course and fine pitch values, try the following program:

10 INPUT "Note value ",n
20 INPUT "Octave ",o
30 LET f=INT(n/2^o)
40 LET c=INT(f/256)
50 PRINT "Fine = ";f;"  Course = ";c

The pitch values required by this program are as follows:
Note	Value	Note	Value
C	3421	F#	2419
C#	3228	G	2283
D	3047	G#	2155
D#	2876	A	2034
E	2715	A#	1920
F	2562	B	1892
